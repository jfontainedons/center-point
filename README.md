# centerPoint

centerPoint() takes three arguments: a pointer to an array of struct point*, the number of points in the array, and a pointer to struct point center. It then calculates the coordinates of the center point (for all the points in the array) and stores it in struct point center. You may not use any square brackets ([]) in centerPoint()
